# sosa. (didn't work out, switched to another project like this)
# my code is the definition of spray and pray.
## google calendar was being a pain so i did what any reasonable person would do and code a knockoff siri :D
i had this idea in period 2 for a "a real assistant to synthesize my thoughts and plan my day".

i figured that it would probably be too much of a waste of time to try and find one that's free so i decided to see how i could make my own.

got started when i got home, we'll see how it goes.

gonna try and at least have something to summarize all of my random thoughts and maybe something that can automatically schedule events.
